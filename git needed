To retrieve all files from a previous commit in Git, follow these steps:

1. Identify the Commit
Find the commit hash of the previous commit you want to retrieve files from:

bash
Copy code
git log
This will display a list of commits. Copy the hash of the desired commit.

2. Check Out Files from the Previous Commit
To retrieve all files from the specific commit, use:

bash
Copy code
git checkout <commit-hash> -- .
Replace <commit-hash> with the hash of the commit you want.
The -- . ensures all files are retrieved.
3. Stage and Commit Changes (Optional)
If you want to keep the retrieved files in the current state of the repository, stage and commit them:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Revert to previous commit files"
Notes:
This method retrieves the files from the previous commit into your working directory but does not move the HEAD pointer to the previous commit.
If you want to completely revert the repository to the previous commit, use:
bash
Copy code
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
However, this will erase all uncommitted changes, so use it cautiously.
Let me know if you'd like clarification on any of these steps!

To retrieve all files from the commit 0a5ea7708cbe4b8425ba5c457ad93ae48406420c (dated Sat Dec 28 13:11:22 2024 +0530) and effectively undo the most recent commit (remove all), follow these steps:

1. Reset to the Previous Commit (Soft Reset)
This will reset your repository to the commit added new without removing your recent changes in the working directory (if you have any).
Run:

bash
Copy code
git reset --soft 0a5ea7708cbe4b8425ba5c457ad93ae48406420c
2. Hard Reset to Fully Restore Previous Files (Optional)
If you want to fully discard all changes made in the last commit and completely restore the state from added new, use:

bash
Copy code
git reset --hard 0a5ea7708cbe4b8425ba5c457ad93ae48406420c
⚠️ Warning: This will overwrite any uncommitted changes.

3. Push Changes to Remote (If Needed)
If this repository is connected to a remote repository (like GitHub or GitLab), you might need to force-push to synchronize the reset:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main --force
Alternate Approach: Checkout Files Without Resetting
If you don't want to reset but just restore the files from the added new commit, you can use:

bash
Copy code
git checkout 0a5ea7708cbe4b8425ba5c457ad93ae48406420c -- .
Then commit the restored files:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Revert files to 'added new' commit"

To retrieve back to the remove all commit after performing the steps to revert to the previous commit (added new), you can do the following:

1. Identify the Commit Hash
You already have the commit hash for remove all from your git log:

bash
Copy code
19a67f337c026b171dd37be8abdc68d358eeef0f
2. Reset or Checkout to the remove all Commit
Option 1: Soft Reset
This will move the HEAD pointer back to the remove all commit, while keeping any changes made to your working directory:

bash
Copy code
git reset --soft 19a67f337c026b171dd37be8abdc68d358eeef0f
Option 2: Hard Reset
This will completely restore your repository to the state of the remove all commit, discarding all other changes:

bash
Copy code
git reset --hard 19a67f337c026b171dd37be8abdc68d358eeef0f
3. Push Changes to Remote (If Needed)
If you've force-pushed after previous steps and now need to push the remove all commit to the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main --force
4. Alternative: Use git checkout
If you just want to retrieve files from the remove all commit without moving HEAD:

bash
Copy code
git checkout 19a67f337c026b171dd37be8abdc68d358eeef0f -- .
Then, stage and commit the changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Revert files to 'remove all' commit"
These steps will allow you to restore your project to the state defined in the remove all commit. Let me know if you encounter any issues!
